tweetCopter
===========

An node.js AR Drone script that pulls commands from twitter,

It allows an unruly mob to all send commands to the copter at once.

Don't let it do many kinds of maneuvers because it will be too chaotic.

I got most of the code from this repo:  https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone

I had to install this:

npm install twit
